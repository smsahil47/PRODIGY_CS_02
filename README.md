This project involves developing a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations such as:

Swapping pixel values to obscure the image.
Applying basic mathematical operations on each pixel (such as addition, subtraction, etc.) to modify the pixel data.
Features:
Load an image and apply pixel-based encryption.
Users can decrypt the image back to its original form by reversing the encryption operations.
Supports basic image processing operations for encryption and decryption
